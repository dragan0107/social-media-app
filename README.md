# **Social Media App**

-   Social media app project (Friendbook) in **_MERN_** **_(MongoDB (mongoose), Express, React, Node.js)_** stack. This is NOT a tutorial copy but It's totally being made from scratch with the knowledge I'm operating with at the moment, where I try to improve both Front and Back-end skills. All the guidance I've had is Google, and taking a look on some examples for design.
